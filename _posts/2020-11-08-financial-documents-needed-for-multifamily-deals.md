If you are considering investing in a real estate syndication, either as a general partner or as a limited partner, you must understand the underlying fundamentals of any potential deal. A multifamily investment property operates as a business. Thus, like any business, the property ought to have a rigorous set of financials attached to it. It's your job as the potential investor to sift through these financials to analyze the underlying value proposition. 

The purpose of this article is to identify the key financial documents you ought to look at when analyzing a property.

### T12 - Trailing 12 Months

This document is a financial statement showing a property's previous 12 months of operation. It is generally used for apartment buildings and other types of multifamily properties. It is not typically used for commercial real estate or other types of businesses.

### T3 - Trailing 3 Months 

Similar to the T12, this document is a quarterly financial statement detailing the property's financials for a specific quarter. Implied by the definition, there are four of these T3 produced throughout the year. In the absence of a T12, a yearly picture of the property's financial standing can be pieced together from the provided T3's.

### Rent Roll

A rent roll is a document which details the rent payments for each and every one of the tenants under lease. The document should at least provide information on name's and information of tenants, lease length, current rent, lease end date, and security deposits. The document is used to get an accurate picture of a property's rental income and potential for increased rents.
