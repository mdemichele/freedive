This article, I'll readily confess, is a bit granular. It is more so for the nerds than the average joe. If you don't care to know the minutia of real estate, then you may not care for this article. If, however, you carry a hidden love for mahogany-stained, 1950's vintage, old styled wood siding, and if you consider yourself part investor, part garage craftsman, then continue to read on. 

There are many different types of construction material. Here, we will cover, in probably too far of depth, the most common types. We will explain their unique characteristics, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.

Inevitably, as an operator, you will be tasked with knowing (or at least knowing someone who knows) these nitty-gritty details of a property. After all, you are the one who owns it. It will behoove you to have more knowledge rather than less.

So, without further ado, let's get nerdy.
