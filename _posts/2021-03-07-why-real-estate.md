Anyone considering investing their money in the multifamily apartment space must first answer--or more likely, has already answered--the inevitable question, "why real estate?" As all investors quickly find out, there are endless avenues of investment and an overwhelming sea of voices, all of which are convinced of their "secret" methods and unique opinions.  There are stocks, there are corporate and government bonds, there is gold, there are cryptocurrencies, and there is an always-eager bevy of well-groomed financial advisors waiting in the wings to pitch you on their innovative, new "day trading, short-selling, risk-adjusted, inflation-hedging options strategy." Perhaps it goes without saying, the methods are many, and the choices are plentiful. 

So, why in this swirling sea of investment opportunities should someone choose real estate? Well, if that is the question you find yourself asking today, allow us to explain exactly why real estate is so incredibly powerful and how it differs from the myriad of other options that exist in the investment world today. 

Why Real Estate Matters to the Investor

Just as there are a long list of investment options, there is also a long list of motivations for investing. Every investor is motivated by different things. Some seek the promise of incredible wealth, some are motivated by fear and a need for security, while others are simply intrigued by the adrenaline-inducing allure of gaming the markets.  Most investors, however, seek something in the middle. More than anything, most investors simply seek an opportunity to improve their financial position while also providing more security for themselves and their families. 

The investment opportunities that meet investors at the center of their diverse motivations are often the ones that are most attractive. Here is where real estate enters the picture.

Unlike most other forms of investment, real estate offers something for nearly everyone. For those motivated by high returns, real estate has the potential for returns far and beyond the 50-year average return of the S&P 500. For those motivated by the need for security, real estate provides a hedge against inflation and the safety of a hard asset. For those motivated simply by pure interest, real estate opens the door to a limitless supply of interesting challenges and creative opportunities. Regardless of your motivations for investing, real estate has something to offer. 

Why Real Estate Works

First and foremost, real estate works because it makes money for those who invest. Plain and simple, real estate is a reliable vehicle to making money, and the value of real estate can be summed up in one single metric: return on investment. 

Return on Investment, or ROI for short, is a measure of the overall return on the money you invest. In its simplest form, ROI is calculated by taking the total net profit from the asset you've invested in (after expenses) and dividing it by the total cost of acquiring that asset. 

ROI  =   Net Profit / Total Cost

This formula will give you a percentage, which tells you the rate of return on your investment.  While ROI is not the end-all-be-all of financial indicators, it does give you good idea of where you stand in comparison to other investment opportunities. 

ROI also reveals a few important facts about maximizing the profitability of an investment. To show you exactly how this works, we'll need to further refine our ROI formula. As noted above, ROI in its simplest form breaks down to net profit divided by total cost.  However, we be can break the formula down even further by defining net profit, which is really gross profit minus total expenses. So, now we our ROI formula will look like this.

ROI = (Gross profit - total expenses) / Total Cost

From this new formula, we can see that there are two powerful ways to increase our ROI. First, by reducing total expenses, we create both a higher net profit and a smaller divisor. Thus, reducing expenses leads to significantly high ROI. Second, we can also increase our gross profit. Unlike stocks, in which we have no control over the profit of a company we are invested in, we do have the ability to increase our gross profits as property owners by increasing rents.
