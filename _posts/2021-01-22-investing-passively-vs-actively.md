If you are reading this article, chances are you are the type of person unafraid of tackling difficult and complicated subjects. You ask difficult question, and you are capable of thinking clearly and critically. If that is so, let us pose one more complicated question to you. 

Should you invest your money passively or actively?

Yes, that is a complicated question. It is the only glib and unsophisticated salesperson who will treat this question as uncomplicated. You have no doubt encountered such salespersons or companies, trumpeting that their investment strategy is the "best investment on the planet" or "Investing in our syndication is the easiest choice you'll ever make." As much as we'd like this to be true, neither of these sentiments is the case in reality.

In reality, deciding how and where you should invest your money is complicated. Anyone who tells you different should be avoided at all costs. Now, in saying it is "complicated," note that I am not saying impossible or too difficult to handle. No, choosing to invest your money is one of the best choices you can make for yourself. That choice, however, should be made carefully and with a healthy dose of caution. 

Here, in this short article, I merely attempt to hand you a tiny dose of this caution by giving you a look at the pros and cons of one choice in your decision making process. I'll attempt to give you some perspective on whether or not you should take an active or passive approach in your investing, and then I will leave it at that. In the end, the choice is, and should remain, yours to make as to where and how you should invest. You should always make the final decision, no matter how well the salespeople pitch you on their product. 

#### So, what are the goals of the investor?
For many, the priority is to spend less time focused on work and more time focused away from work. These are the people who should focus on passive investment. Generally speaking, passive investing takes the form of investing money in an asset class, like stocks, bonds, or real estate, and watching that investment grow in value over time. Investments of this type require little to no work on the part of the investor; yet, they can boast returns typically in the range of 8%-15%. That is incredibly valuable. 

Many investors choose to passively invest their money out of a desire for additional security. Those who are conservative with their money and risk aversive sometimes opt to let a professional money manager handle their investments for them. The knowledge that someone with more experience and knowledge is handling their money is often a secure feeling.

Other investors, however, opt for a more active investment approach. These are generally the types of people who are not risk averse or afraid of losing money. Here, we think of entrepreneurs and day traders. These types of people take bigger risks but can often reap larger rewards. 

Ultimately, the decision between passive investing and active investing comes down to many of the factors described in this article. Each and every person is different and has different levels of risk tolerance. Each individual should take into consideration their own personal aptitudes and attitudes towards money. There are no hard and fast rules for investing your money. The beautiful thing is that there are endless ways to make money.
