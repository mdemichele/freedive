Lately, the central theme of my reading has been the concepts of risk and randomness. I seldom give thought to these subjects, however, whether we like it or not, they occupy a profoundly central place in the way I think, process new information, and make decisions in everyday life. Risk, randomness, and uncertainty are the real elements that determine our everyday decisions. From the decision to go to the gym today to the decision to go surfing, I am guided by a system of risk determination. I make an unconscious decision to go to the gym, not because I actually enjoy being there, but because I have weighed the risk of being more out of shape tomorrow. If I don’t go to the gym today, the probability that I will feel more unhealthy tomorrow is fairly high.
