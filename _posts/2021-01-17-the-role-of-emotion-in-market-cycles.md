Like most everything in life, financial markets change dramatically over time. They are not static and immovable structures. Instead, markets are like the ever-moving ocean tide, rolling in and out in perpetual cycles of boom and bust. Fortunes have been made in the raging euphoria of bull markets, and fortunes have been lost in the furious swing back down. As inevitable as the tide, markets have always and will continue to operate in this cyclical pattern. 

Emotion and Market Cycles
Markets, at their core, are fundamentally gigantic collections of humans operating together to buy and sell agreed upon goods. Consequently, markets reflect the fickle attitudes and behaviors of the humans involved. 

As anyone who has tried to buy groceries at a supermarket knows, we humans are nothing if not fickle. We make a decision, then change our minds; then flip back and forth until finally opting for the original choice anyway. We are driven endlessly by the highs and lows of our emotions, which jitter restlessly from moment to moment.

Our behavior in financial marketplaces is no different. Just as in the supermarket, we don't often make rational decisions with our money. As much as we'd like to think of ourselves as rational individuals, especially when it comes to our finances, we are inevitably and inescapably chained to the sub-rational pull of our emotions. When we decide where and how to invest our money, we aren't making the decision based on facts and numbers as much as on emotional considerations, such as quelling our insecurity and fear.  

Our susceptibility to emotional decision-making is what gives the markets their volatility. When crises and attention-snatching events occur, investors panic. When investors panic, the markets plummets. Likewise, when the sun shines and wealth begins to rain down freely, investors become blinded by greed and throw their money at anything with the word "investment." The pattern of fear and avarice is a fundamental law of the markets.

And so, it comes as no surprise that financial history is replete with dramatic examples of the roaring spoils brought about by investor optimism and the pulverizing lows brought about by investor panic. In recent memory alone, we need look no further than the tumultuous housing market crash of 2008.  Although much more complex than this, the crash was caused, in large part, by the predatory lending practices of large banking institutions. Fueled by blinding greed and pure short-sighted stupidity, these institutions underwrote risky mortgage loans to borrowers who had no business acquiring such loans. For their part, the borrowers themselves, blinded their own greedy optimism, happily gobbled up these loans, straddling themselves with more debt than they could possibly manage unless the then-rising housing prices continued to keep them afloat. However, when the impossibly inflated housing prices finally fell, the entire market collapsed and the long interwoven chain of once-optimistic borrowers and lenders lost everything.  When the market collapsed, the entire world fell into a panic - one that if you are old enough to read this article you certainly remember.

However, as troubling as the events of 2008 were, they are by no means singular or unique. Previous crashes happened in 2000, with the dot-com bubble, in 1987, with the event of "Black Monday," and, in 1974, with the fallout of uncontrolled inflation and a stagnating US economy. Those still are not the only market crashes of note. There are countless other examples of wild, rocketing swings upward followed by plummeting falls back to earth. 

Inevitably, in each and every instance, investor emotion ruled the day. Time and time again, when investors react, either optimistically or pessimistically, the market follows suit. When investors are optimistic, the markets go up. And when they panic, the markets go down. If the examples of history teach us anything, it is that everyone, whether financial expert, large banking institution, or common investor, is moored to this fundamental principle.   

So, now that we have a thirty second education on financial history, how do we react and why in the world would we willingly continue to invest our money, knowing that the threat of financial collapse is always lurking silently in the dark waiting for us to slip? Well, the answer is not to run from our silent predators but to prepare for the things we can't anticipate.

How to capitalize on market swings?
With the exception the emotionally dead inside and perhaps Warren Buffett, we are all intimately acquainted with what it's like to make a poor decision because of some loss of emotional control. Most all of us have a story or two of a purchase or tattoo (that's for you, Tyler lol) that seemed like an excellent idea in the heat of frantic and excited decision-making. Likewise, we can also can point to equally painful memories of opportunities missed because of irrational fear or worry.  As we accumulate these unsavory experiences, we put measures into place to prevent us from making these same poor choices in the future. We form rules and guidelines for ourselves to follow. Then, the next time we feel the irresistible urge to buy the brand new 27" Boston Whaler we've been talking about forever, we can resist the emotional impulse by referencing our rule of not buying things we can't afford when we're out drinking with our friends. 

The same is true when it comes to investing. The successful investor plans ahead of time for the moments of emotional irrationality. In the heat of widespread euphoria or panic, the real winners in the market are the ones who have already prepared ahead of time for the inevitable swings. As other investors frantically rush to pull their money out or pour their money in, successful investors remain committed to principled and disciplined investing practices.  In doing so, these investors both protect themselves from unforeseen risks and capitalize on unpredictable opportunities, all without reference to emotional decision-making. 

So, what are these principled and disciplined investing practices?
