The ocean is a home for me. It welcomes me with open arms and feeds the deepest parts of myself. It's something I don't think I could live without. 

The older I've gotten, the more I've realized that I'm just not myself when I'm away from the ocean. At 25, I left Maui for Seattle. Almost a year later, I moved even further away from the ocean to Phoenix. I've been away from the ocean now for almost two years straight. It's funny how being away from something helps crystalize what's actually important for you.

I've since realized that it was only in connection to the ocean that I discovered what I really enjoyed. The only times in my life where I've been truly at peace have been in the ocean. This isn't to say that I'm unhappy away from the ocean, but it is an acknowledgement that the ocean is a part of my ability to find myself and understand who I am and who I want to be.
