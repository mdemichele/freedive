Central Problem: What is my understanding of value investing and how does it impact my personal investment strategy.

There is nothing I can say about investing that hasn't already been said before. More to the point, there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said by someone wildly more successful than I am. There are endless investors who's net worth is a hundred  times more than mine. Dare I say, quite literally, a million times more than mine. If you want an original opinion, you should look to them. 

Here, back in Average Investor Land, I speak only of the things I have learned from others- the things I myself am struggling alongside everyone else to put into practice. Here in this domain, it is infinitely wiser to heed the advice of those who have backed their principles with a proven track record of success. Wiser still, it is even more important to not heed  the jejune advice of those without one.

With this said, I confess that I am neither an expert nor an investor with a long and pedigreed track record of success. Unfailing optimism aside, I am, in truth, a wide-eyed twenty-four year old brashly stepping foot in the wild and undulating sea of investing. Saying that I am speaking to things above my head is an understatement. I am undoubtedly lost at sea without a paddle (to use a metaphor I didn't make up). However, as is stupidly obvious when you are actually lost in a real ocean, I have learned that when you don't know what you are doing, cling tightly to something that floats. As I have begun my journey as an investor, I have learned that the principles of value investing and the wise explicators of its principles are that something that floats. Cling to them, and you will survive.

So here in this article, I make no attempt at original opinion. Here, I will simply attempt to point out a few sage principles of value investing and attempt an explanation at each one. Being that these are timeless principles which have been expounded upon to no end by countless others,  it should be readily apparent why these principles are so valuable and why they have so patiently stood the test of time. They speak for themselves. They need no justification from me. As you read, I hope you will see their incredible import and will understand why, like myself, you should look to these principles before propounding opinions of your own.

Underlying Value and the Mitigation of Risk

Fundamentally, value investing is the art and practice of finding out the underlying value of an asset and buying it for less than it is worth. It is truthfully more art than practice. Put more precisely and in the words of an actual authority, namely the estimable investor and author of Margin of Safety, Seth Klarmin, "[value investing] is simply the practice of determining the value underlying a security and then buying it at a considerable discount from that value. It is really that simple." 

In the camp of value investors, you will not find messy-haired and scatterbrained millennial day traders, hunched over a convoluted computer screen, with eyes darting back and forth between hourly market charts and wildly undulating line graphs. Nor will you find the well dressed salesman come financial advisor boasting of his next great "unique investment opportunity."

No, in my slightly fantastical imagination,  I like to think that the value investor is a much different, more plodding and invariant breed. Much more Warren Buffet than Jordan Belfort; more calculated than braggadocios.  The value investor is one who is well-versed in the language of company financials and is unafraid-perhaps even a little giddy-at the thought of draining away the evening hours immersed in report after report, document after document. At his or her core, the value investor is one who understands that the asset, not the market, is the real prize. 

Indeed, the insight that the underlying asset, rather than the frenetic swings of the market, is the real object of fascination is the fundamental insight of the value investors. Unlike the day traders and market watchers, the value investors have long understood that an asset's value will always and inevitably be tied to the soundness of the underlying business and the ability of the people who run it, despite the state of the market or the swings it induces. 

The value investors, then, play the game with a very different set of rules. The value investor's game is much simpler, albeit less glamorous.
