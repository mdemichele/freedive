Introduction: 
There are risks involved in investing in real estate syndications. If you are a passive investor, you should know these risks thoroughly. If you are a syndicator, you should communicate these risks thoroughly.

What Are Real Estate Syndications: 
Fundamentally, real estate syndications are a group of people organized together in order to pool their capital together for investment in real estate. The fundamentals of Syndications have been explained in great detail many times. For a good synopsis on the basics of real estate syndication, see this article by _____.

5 Risks For Passive Investors

Being limited partners, Passive investors have no say in the management of the investment property or over the operating procedures governing the general partner.
For many investors, this is a key advantage. You, as a passive investor, don't have to manage anything.Â  The returns you make through a syndication are entirely passive and require no work. You don't have to handle finding a property management company. You don't have to handle rehabbing the property. You don't have to ever set a foot on the property itself. If you have limited time and no desire to manage the ins and outs of a multi-faceted apartment business, this is the ideal scenario.

This, however, is also where the risk enters the picture. By removing yourself from the duties of management, you are placing complete trust in the general partners. 

Passive investors must trust the General Partner's evaluation of a property's value.
In most real estate syndications, the general partner bears the responsibility for analyzing the investment property's underlying value. 

Passive investors must trust the reliability and experience of the General Partner, many of whom have little experience and have few regulations.
Real estate syndications can be an extremely lucrative business. Because of this, the space is filled with no shortage of bad actors, dishonest, and quite frankly, incompetent general partners. Very few regulations pertaining to syndications exist. Nearly anyone can form a syndication and pass themselves off as experienced and capable general partners. As a passive investor, you should always do your due diligence on the trustworthiness, competency, and transparency of the syndicators. This can't be stressed enough. Know who you are investing with. Regardless of how well the syndicators market themselves, there is always tremendous risk in investing your money with a company you know little about. 

The Returns and Tax benefits of an investment may not be as high as the General Partner promises
The minute you visit a syndicator's website, you will be hit with a wave of euphoric promises trumpeting that syndications are "the best investment on the planet" or "the tax benefits alone outperform stocks every time." Such statements are the often over-enthusiastic ploys of pitchy salesmen and desperate syndicators. While the returns on many syndications are indeed above-average, this will not always and inevitably be the case. As the investor shelling out your own money to general partners, it is important to understand for yourself exactly what the promised returns really are, what the associated tax benefits really are, and what the potentially upside is. The general partners will not do the research for you. Being that syndicators are looking to get your money, be aware that they have a motivation to highlight the potential upside and downplay the potential risk. Be wary of any general partners who do not take the time to fully explain the potential risks and downsides. As much as we wish it were the case, no investment is risk-free. Any general partner who tells you otherwise should be avoided at all costs. 

Passive investors must be aware of the lack of transferability and liquidity.
To beat an already-thrice dead horse, we are not legal or tax professionals, so don't mistake this for legal or tax advice. Generally speaking, most syndications buy and hold apartments buildings for a period of five to seven years. Thus, investing in such a syndication means tying your capital up for a long period of time. This tying up of capital means less liquidity for you, the passive investor. 

You should know that syndicators are compensated for their role as general partners.
The general partner performs a massive amount of work throughout the deal. They source the deal, underwrite it, perform due diligence, handle closing procedures, rehab the property, place management, and ultimately sell the property. Given the heavy workload and highly complicated waters they must navigate, the general partner rightly expects to be properly compensated. General partners are compensated in the form of a single acquisition fee upon buying the property, regular management fees while the property is under the syndication's control, and a disposition fee upon selling the property. These fees are generally in the range of _______ to ______ percent. You should expect the general partner to ask around this percentage in fees. Unscrupulous general partners can take advantage of this, however, and slide in higher fees than warranted. You should be aware of these fees.

General Partners are susceptible to conflicts of interest and may act selfishly to preserve their own capital
